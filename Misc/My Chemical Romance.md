>My friend loves Chemistry very much specially the elements. Once I asked him the wifi password he gave me some numbers like `186808155710` and told me that the number are in group of two like `1008` -> `10 and 08/8`. Can you help to gather the wifi password? (Note: It forms a complete word, so you might have to leave out something).

--------------------

Based on the description, this password is likely linked to periodic table elements. We are also told that the password represents a real word, so the element letters might not exactly translate to the answer.

From `186808155710` we can separate into elements:
`18 68 08 15 57 10`
Using periodic table, element letters are as follows:
`ar er o p la ne`
indeed `areroplane` doesn't work, however this looks similar to the word `aeroplane`. Trying this as the flag works.
`n00bz{aeroplane}`
