The image is a pictogram for certain sign languages, but what language? I am no expert in sign language so I begin with random google searching.
A brief search for American Sign Language alphabet gives me hand shapes that look similar:

Decoding the message based on the hand shapes shown in this chart we get the following:

AMERIC
ANSIGN
LANGUA
GEDECO
DED
```
rephrased: `American sign language decoded`. 

`n00bz{americansignlanguagedecoded}`
